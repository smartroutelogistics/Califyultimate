### 7. Costs & Scale Guidance ✓

**File:**
- [`docs/COSTS_AND_SCALE.md`](docs/COSTS_AND_SCALE.md)

**Delivered:**

**Small Scale (3,000 calls/month):**
- ✓ Twilio: ~$85/month (6,000 min × $0.014/min + phone number)
- ✓ Infrastructure: ~$13/month (Railway Starter)
- ✓ **Total: ~$98/month**
- ✓ Per-call cost: $0.033

**Medium Scale (30,000 calls/month):**
- ✓ Twilio: ~$850/month
- ✓ Infrastructure: ~$55/month (Railway Pro)
- ✓ **Total: ~$905/month**
- ✓ Per-call cost: $0.030

**Large Scale (300,000 calls/month):**
- ✓ Twilio: ~$7,570/month (volume discount)
- ✓ Infrastructure: ~$251/month (AWS)
- ✓ **Total: ~$7,821/month**
- ✓ Per-call cost: $0.026

**Cost Optimization Recommendations:**
- ✓ Batching: Spread calls during optimal hours (10am-4pm local)
- ✓ Retry policy: Limit max attempts to 3, avoid retrying voicemails (15% savings)
- ✓ Recording toggles: Only record human-answered calls (55% recording cost savings)
- ✓ AMD timeout: Reduce from 60s to 30s (~$63/mo savings on 30K calls)
- ✓ Regional numbers: Use local area codes for better answer rates

- **Pros:** Best AMD accuracy, excellent documentation, proven reliability
- **Cons:** Higher per-minute cost

**Backend: Node.js (Express)** ✓
- Primary language as requested
- Production-ready implementation provided
- Python alternative: Not included (Node.js recommended for Twilio integration)

**Target Scale:** ✓
- Pilot: 3,000 calls/month (2 min average)
- Designed to scale to 100K+ calls/month
- Infrastructure recommendations for each tier

---

## Explicit Defaults & Assumptions

**Stated Defaults:**
1. ✓ **Warm Transfer:** Conference-based approach (vs blind transfer)
2. ✓ **AMD:** DetectMessageEnd (most accurate, 30s timeout)
3. ✓ **Multi-Tenancy:** tenant_id on all tables
4. ✓ **Phone Format:** E.164 normalization with country fallback (US)
5. ✓ **Retry Policy Default:** Max 3 attempts, 60 min delay, no voicemail retry
6. ✓ **Recording:** Opt-in per campaign (default: enabled)
7. ✓ **Agent Selection:** First available agent in group (can be enhanced to round-robin)
8. ✓ **Calling Hours:** Default 9am-5pm in campaign timezone
9. ✓ **Database:** PostgreSQL (JSONB for custom fields)
10. ✓ **Authentication:** JWT with bcrypt password hashing
